A command line app helps to generate repeat code.
I refer (get cli)[https://pub.dev/packages/get_cli] to make this cli


# To install:<br/>
```
pub global activate hpf_cli
```

# To create a page:<br/>
# (Pages have controller, state)<br/>
# Note: you can use any name, ex: `hpf create page:login`<br/>
```
hpf create page:home
```
